        <!-- FOUNDER'S NOTE -->
        <div class="about-block">
            <h2>FOUNDER’S NOTE</h2>

            <p>Grey Space started as a reaction.</p>

            <p>A reaction to the noise, the certainty, the constant pressure to pick a side or accept a headline at face value. I kept noticing that the things which actually shape events rarely announce themselves loudly. They sit in the margins, in the pauses, in the parts of the story that don’t fit neatly into a post or a talking point.</p>

            <p>This isn’t a platform designed to tell you what to think. It exists to slow the moment down, to look again, and to stay with uncertainty long enough for something clearer to emerge.</p>

            <p>Much of my life has been spent in environments where information is incomplete and decisions still have to be made. That way of seeing the world shaped Grey Space. It’s less interested in speed than in judgement, and less concerned with being first than with being right.</p>

            <p>This space won’t always feel finished. That’s deliberate. Reality is rarely resolved, and analysis that pretends otherwise tends to miss what matters most. Grey Space will change as events do, guided by relevance rather than momentum.</p>

            <p>If you’ve found your way here, you probably feel that too — that most truth lives somewhere between certainty and chaos. If this space helps you navigate that ground with a little more clarity, then it’s serving its purpose.</p>

            <p>— Jack</p>

        <!-- WHO WE ARE -->
        <div class="about-block">
            <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
            <p>Grey Space was created for people who want to understand the world, not just watch it scroll past. We’re an OSINT‑driven intelligence platform built by a team with over a decade of experience in open‑source analysis, source verification, and structured reporting. Our aim is simple: bring professional‑grade clarity to the civilian world.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- WHAT WE DO -->
        <div class="about-block">
            <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
            <p>Grey Space turns global events into structured understanding. Instead of endless updates, we give you context. Instead of noise, we give you relevance. Instead of commentary, we give you clarity. Every part of the platform is built around three questions: where is this happening, why does it matter, and how does it affect the bigger picture.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- HOW WE DO IT -->
        <div class="about-block">
            <h2>HOW WE DO IT</h2>
            <p>We blend automation with human judgement. APIs and AI models collect and structure information from open‑source platforms. Our methodology filters, verifies, and prioritises what matters. Analysis connects events across politics, security, economics, and society. The result is a platform that doesn’t overwhelm you with data — it organises it.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- LIVE FEED -->
        <div class="about-block">
            <h2>THE LIVE FEED</h2>
            <p>The Live Feed shows what is happening right now. It tracks developing events in real time, categorised by theme and mapped geographically. It’s built for awareness and orientation — a way to see the world as it moves. Fast, factual, and intentionally minimal.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- BRIEFING ROOM -->
        <div class="about-block">
            <h2>THE BRIEFING ROOM</h2>
            <p>The Briefing Room is where the noise stops. It takes the raw signal from the Live Feed and turns it into understanding — prioritised, connected, and explained. It’s a calm, deliberate space designed for clarity, not constant scrolling. Eventually, it will become a paid space — not for exclusivity, but to protect focus and integrity.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- MAP -->
        <div class="about-block">
            <h2>THE MAP</h2>
            <p>The map gives context to events — not just where they happened, but how locations connect across time. Filters let you explore political, military, economic, social, and Grey Space activity. Links and past data show how stories evolve. It turns global events into something you can see, not just read.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- GREY SPACE -->
        <div class="about-block">
            <h2>GREY SPACE</h2>
            <p>Grey Space is the layer beneath everything else. It’s not a category — it cuts across all of them. It covers influence operations, cyber activity, economic pressure, coercion, proxy behaviour, and below‑the‑threshold competition. These aren’t dramatic events. They’re signals — subtle, strategic, and often overlooked.</p>

            <p>Across the platform, Grey Space appears as a quiet but constant layer: in the Briefing Room through dedicated Grey Space briefs, on the map as a toggle revealing sub‑threshold activity, in country profiles as a view of ongoing pressure and influence, and in analysis through explainers that show how modern power works when it isn’t visible.</p>

            <p>Grey Space also appears inside stories themselves — showing where subversive activity is happening, who is behind it, and how even small actions can shape outcomes. It’s the intelligence layer that turns isolated events into patterns.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- WHY GREY SPACE EXISTS -->
        <div class="about-block">
            <h2>WHY GREY SPACE EXISTS</h2>
            <p>Most platforms tell you what happened. Grey Space tells you why it matters. This is a platform for curious individuals, professionals, researchers, and anyone who wants to understand the world without being overwhelmed by it. Grey Space is built on one principle: Signal Over Noise.</p>
